<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Universal-CollapsingTabLayout</strong>
    (the “Library”) handles information.
</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1. About the Library</h2>
    <p>
        Universal-CollapsingTabLayout is an open-source Android UI library that provides
        an integration of <code>CollapsingToolbarLayout</code> and <code>TabLayout</code>.
        The Library is distributed under the MIT License and is intended for use by developers
        as part of their own applications.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The Library itself does <strong>not collect, store, process, or transmit</strong>
        any personal data or user information.
    </p>
    <p>
        It does not access device identifiers, location data, network data, or any other
        personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
        Note: If this Library is integrated into an application that collects user data,
        such data collection is governed by the privacy policy of that application,
        not by this Library.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The Library does not include or depend on any third-party analytics, advertising,
        tracking SDKs, or external services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any third-party services used in an application that integrates this Library
        are the responsibility of the application developer.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since the Library does not collect or handle any user data, there is no data storage
        or transmission performed by the Library itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The source code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone to verify
        its behavior.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to the Library
        or for clarification purposes. Any updates will be published along with the source code
        repository or associated documentation.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>6. Contact</h2>

        you may contact the maintainer at:

    <p>Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies only to the Universal-CollapsingTabLayout library
        itself and does not apply to applications that use the Library.
